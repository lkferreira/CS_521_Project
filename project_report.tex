  \section{Introduction}

  Packet-switched networks break streams of data into small blocks known as packets. Each of these packets are then sent
  independently over a shared network, based on the destination address in each packet. After receiving, packets are reassembled
  in the proper sequence to make up the message. Data is processed at all intermediate node including source system. The
  delay between data units is not uniform. It is suitable for handling bilateral traffic. And, multiple users can use the
  same channel while transferring their packets. If one route is failed the data can be routed from other paths too.

  Circuit-switched networks require dedicated point-to-point connections. The resources needed are reserved for the duration
  of the communication between the end systems. It was designed specifically for voice communication and packet switched
  networks handled data. Data is processed only at source system. And, the delay between data units is uniform. Circuit
  switching is not convenient for handling bilateral traffic. It is preferred when the communication is long and continuous.

  To compare the performance of packet-switched and circuit-switched networks, we created an event-based simulation model
  for either network. A series of experiments were designed to test how either network reacts to packets being sent across
  them, and whether one has an overall better performance than the other.


  \section{Analysis}

  \subsection{Methodology}

  To compare and contrast the performance of packet switching and circuit switching, two event-based simulation models
  written in Python were created to simulate a packet switching network and a circuit switching network. The intent of
  creating these models was to provide numerical insight into how the time data packets spend traveling through a network
  is affected by the effects of packet switching and circuit switching. By generating statistics such as average data packet
  queue delay and average data packet total delay for a network simulation, a strong basis for comparing the two types of
  networks was formulated.

  For both simulations, a simple bi-directional network graph consisting of six nodes was used, as shown in Figure 2.1, where fixed-size data packets
  are randomly generated at node 0, and sent through the network where their destination is always node 5. The models
  created allow for the mean arrival rate of each new data packet, the total simulation duration, and the transmission time
  between nodes to be manually set. For example, a circuit switching simulation could be run with a new packet mean arrival time of 500 milliseconds, a
  total simulation duration of two hours, and a transmission time between nodes of 80 milliseconds. Note that the transmission delay
  at the network nodes is disregarded. At the end of each simulation, the results, which include average queue delay and total delay statistics, are printed to the console.

  \end{figure}

  The circuit switching model simulates the way circuit switching networks are implemented by dedicating an entire channel
  through the network from source to destination when a data packet is ready to be transmitted. Whenever new data packets are generated and cannot be transmitted
  because the there are no available channels, they enter a queue where they remain until new channels become available. This
  process is illustrated in Figure 2.2. The packet switching model has a different mechanism for handling channels when data packets
  are being transmitted through the network. Rather than securing the entire channel from a data packet's destination node to its
  source node, the packet switching model only secures individual channels between two different nodes as a data packet moves throughout its
  assigned path. For example, if a data packet being transmitted from node 0 to node 5, which has been assigned the path 0-1-2-5, is
  traveling through the 1-2 channel, only the 1-2 channel is secured, and thus blocked. Whenever a data packet arrives at a new node,
  it checks if the next channel it needs to use is available. If it isn't, it searches for a new channel which can lead the data packet
  to its destination. If no other channels are available, the data packet is inserted into a queue belonging to the last node it
  visited. As new channels become available, the data packet is popped from the queue and resumes its trip to its destination. The
  packet switching process is illustrated in Figure 2.3.

  \section{Code and Output}

  Source code and code output have been attached to this report: see \verb|out.txt| for output
  generated for Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 2.4 and 2.5; see \verb|out-40ms-MAT.txt| for output
  generated with a 40 ms mean arrival time; see the Python files for source code for the
  simulations.

  \section{Observations}

  We contrast the efficacies of both switching methods in Figures 2.4 and 2.5. In the figures, we
  observe how each method scales in different configurations of transmission time and average
  arrival time. In Figure 2.4, we set the average total delay as a function of the average packet
  arrival time, with each line representing a fixed transmission time, from 20 ms to 50 ms with 10 ms jumps. Comparing the performance of circuit and packet switching, there is a clear efficiency
  disparity; while packet switching stays relatively constant with the arrival-transmission
  time configurations, circuit switching shows extreme service degradation as transmission time
  grows larger than the average arrival time, with the 42 ms-50 ms arrival-transmission
  configuration having more than two times the average total delay than the 42-40 configuration
  and almost two times the total delay than the 54-50 configuration. This observation is further
  reinforced by the results from \verb|out-40ms-MAT.txt|: the 40-50 configuration has an average
  total delay of over 4,000 ms, greater than the 42-50 configuration by a factor of nearly 20.

  In Figure 2.5, we instead set the average total delay as a function of transmission time.
  Similarly to Figure 2.4, we see that circuit switching shows great service degradation;
  the 42-50 configuration follows an interpolated exponential curve, while every other
  configuration follow interpolated linear curves.

  From the observed results, it is clear that as the arrival-transmission ratio tends to 0---in
  other words, as the transmission time tends to a value greater than the average arrival time
  ---performance tends to degrade using both methods. However, circuit switching demonstrates much
  worse degradations, as having longer transmission times under the circuit switching model
  specifically implies that the transmission channels the packets travel through must stay
  dedicated to transmitting their respective packets for longer, resulting in exorbitantly large
  packet queues, filled with packets actively waiting for when a route to their destinations
  opens up, further evidenced by the exorbitant increase in average queue delay within the circuit
  switching average queuing delay for the $x$-50 configurations seen in Figure 2.4. This problem is
  largely mitigated under the packet switching model as packets do not need an entire route being
  open to be transmitted; instead, packets only need an (acyclic) open router node towards their
  destinations.

  \section{Conclusion}

  From our network simulations, it is self-evident that packet switching is the superior switching
  method over circuit switching; with a much more modular and granular design in that packets do
  not have to reserve an entire route for itself and instead only need to move along routers as
  they open, packet switching offers a much more optimized service over circuit switching. This
  finding makes sense in the context of the general purpose for packet switching infrastructure:
  since the packet switching infrastructure was built to handle a multi-user environment where
  there are multiple end users communicating to a variety of entities simultaneously at any given
  time, packet switching is the clear choice in dealing with and servicing general data
  communications, like Internet traffic.

  Circuit switching is not without its merit, however; while circuit switching does not hold up
  well against the demands of data communications, its use in voice communications specifically
  still makes sense, to an extent. Comparatively, data communications are much more complex than
  voice communications and thus require a similarly more complex architecture to service it, but
  since (stationary) voice communications are much more simple in that communications only require
  one dedicated channel for some set amount of time, circuit switching makes sense not only to
  reduce switching complexity, but to also keep a consistent service over the dedicated channel.
  However, especially with the modern need of mobility among voice technologies, the utility of
  circuit switching leaves much to be desired, leaving packet switching as the overall better
  switching method across all metrics.
